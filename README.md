# unity-2d-experiments
=============================

2D Game study project, it was used in 2017 on my experiments about Game Development.

This is the result of the trainning using the material from [Level Up](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCetfSquMy40hkTGSh0cRYHQ), thanks to [Gabriel Barbosa] (https://twitter.com/gabrieelbarbosa).

Thanks also to [Games Indie] (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEbEugtl-gIHmFQFmlgNcKQ), another Brazilian YT Channel with a lot of good material about Unity3D Engine.
